# WUSE

Wuse (Web Using Shadow Elements) is a Web Components library that encapsulates the usage of the Custom Elements Registry and the Shadow DOM features of ES6. Additionally, it offers an IoC event-driven lifecycle, a pure javascript approach to markup and styles generation, optional reactivity for fields, and much more.

> This is a work in progress, with a lot of things in an experimental stage. More documentation, tests and examples to come.
